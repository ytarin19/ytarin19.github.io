        What makes a remodel? A remodel is someone that we look up to.
        Whether they are famous or not, when looking up to someone you want
        to have similaries to this peron or to even just achieve a little
        of what they have in your own way.

        The remodel that I most admire have the following characteristics.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Genuine - written lyrics can make people feel a certain way</li>
        <li>Motivate others - make it known that people can change their outcome in life</li>
        <li>Does not follow they norm - stays true to myselfs and speaks up on topics.</li>
        <li>Smart - the use their voice in a good way knowing they have a big impact</li>
        <li>Integrity - They stand for what they beileve in</li>
    </ul>
